changes:
  - refactor: Refactored the Addition, Binary Decimal, Comparison, Logic, List Literal,
      (and so on) components. Several of these components can now add/remove their
      input and output ports.
  - balance: Increased the health of drone shells and also made them repairable with
      a welder. They can also now charge in borg chargers.
