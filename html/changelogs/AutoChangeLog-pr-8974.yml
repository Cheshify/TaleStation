changes:
  - balance: Mundane sword-like and medieval weapons are not able to block tackles,
      xenomorph tackles and body throws.
  - balance: The double-energy sword and energy sword have trouble blocking physical
      projectiles, body throws and tackles.
  - balance: The double-energy sword also no longer has guaranteed energy projectile
      deflection; only doing so on a successful block (75% chance to block).
  - balance: But it does have 40 force now, so it is more lethal a weapon. Traitors
      can purchase the sword for only 13 TC (down from 16 TC).
  - balance: The combat energy shield (The one you hold) now functions as a normal
      shield (it used to only protect you against energy projectiles and nothing else).
      It loses guaranteed energy projectile deflection, but still reflects the projectile
      so on a block.
  - balance: The MODsuit shield module only has one charge, but recharges every 10
      seconds. It also costs 8 TC (down from 15). It is also now in the Core Gear
      beginner box (bringing the total price up to 22 TC).
