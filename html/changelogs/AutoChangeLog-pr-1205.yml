changes:
  - rscadd: XenoBotany is here! Well, sorta.
  - rscadd: XenoBotany content can be accessed from the Xenobiologist job. You'll
      be given a locker spawner with a few things in it. Right now, its just hydroponics
      with gatfruit. Sometimes you win some, sometimes you lose some.
  - balance: Some plants have been removed from hydroponics, and now can only exclusively
      be grown in XenoBotany.
  - rscadd: 'SandPoot: XenoBotany TGUI backend.'
  - spellcheck: Fixed a minute typo in the Asset Protections locker spawner beacon.
