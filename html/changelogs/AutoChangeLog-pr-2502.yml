changes:
  - bugfix: fixed exosuit ammo boxes not updating their sprite/description properly
      when emptied
  - bugfix: fixed exosuit ammo being almost universal for all guns
  - bugfix: fixed iron cost for BRM-6 missile ammo and SGL-6 Flashbang launcher ammo
      (flashbang 500 -> 4000; missiles 500 -> 8000)
  - bugfix: exosuit ammo boxes can be recycled in an autolathe, as they were apparently
      intended to be. Partially depleted ammo boxes will have less material in them.
