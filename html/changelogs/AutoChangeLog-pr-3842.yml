changes:
  - rscadd: 'Dogs will now occasionally bark at their two mortal enemies: felinids
      and mailmen'
  - bugfix: Dogs set to attack will now only close within 3 tiles of their target,
      and must be approached further by their target (or pushed next to their target)
      to actually attack
