changes:
  - spellcheck: Fixes a typo in the cult heal spell feedback message.
  - spellcheck: fixes some internal typos related to the word "auxillary".
  - bugfix: Purged pointless punctuation from probabalistic phenomenon publications
  - bugfix: Projectiles fired by non-mob sources (IE turrets) now log reagents contained
      after hitting a target.
  - admin: Cleaned up projectile reagent logging a little.
  - admin: Projectiles fired from mecha will now combat log on the target AND the
      firer.
  - admin: Mecha chassis logs will now contain the name/ckey of the person who fired
      the mecha's weapon.
  - admin: Projectiles fired from vehicles are now more likely to be combat logged
      properly after hitting a target (this logs for all people with control of the
      mecha which is a little messy with multi-seat mecha. Check the vehicle's logs
      or a user's combat logs for the person that actually SHOT the projectile.)
  - admin: Silenced grav generator admin warnings / logging messages when the round
      is not currently in progress.
  - bugfix: Pirate ships now work again.
