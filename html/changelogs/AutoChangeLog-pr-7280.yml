changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed fired foam darts, gumballs and (harmless) lollipops being embeddable.
  - bugfix: 'Projectiles that should embed while being reusable will now do so correctly,
      actually embedding the reusable casing instead of a shrapnel. balance: Arrows
      are generally more likely to embed now, except for blazing ones, that kind of
      just blaze.'
