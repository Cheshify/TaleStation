changes:
  - refactor: Lobstrosities are now basic mobs and have different AI behaviour. Please
      report anything which seems like it shouldn't be happening.
  - rscadd: Lobstrosities will now only opportunistically attack things they have
      knocked over with their charge, and are otherwise timid.
  - rscadd: Lobstrosities are hungry for fingers and will steal one of your arms if
      they defeat you in combat, although this gives you time to crawl away.
