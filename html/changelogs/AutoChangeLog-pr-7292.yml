changes:
  - refactor: Morphs are now basic mobs with a nice new ability to help you change
      forms rather than the old shift-click method, much more intuitive.
  - admin: With the morph rework comes a new ability you can add to mobs, "Assume
      Form". Feel free to add that to any simple or basic mob for le funnies as Runtime
      turns into a pen or something.
