      helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by their bald
      helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their MODsuit, wearing
      a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted in more than a few operatives
      prematurely detonating their implants! BUT NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!
  - qol: There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of gear for
      success as an operative. This is right at the top of the uplink, you can't miss

      their baseline equipment NOW.

      if it exceeds the available (private or cargo depending on the mode of ordering)

  - bugfix: Fixes tesla zaps being weird.
  - admin: Logs explosions from explosive zaps.
  - bugfix: Bitrunners can no longer get mass-mindswapped out of their avatar when
      the wizard does the event. Something about machinery and magic not going well
      together.

      every melee attack! Beware! Please report any bugs.
2023-11-03:
  Melbert:
  - qol: Clicking on an adjacent dense object (or mob) with Spray Cleaner will now
      spritz it rather than doing nothing. This means you can use Spray Cleaner to
      clean bloodied windows, as the janitor gods intended. It also means you can
      fill a spray bottle with Napalm, I guess.
  - refactor: Any cleaning object can now clean a microwave.
  - balance: Changelings gutted by Megafauna now take 8x as long to finalize revival
      stasis (~5 minutes).

  - refactor: Proteon constructs now use the basic mob framework. The ones encountered
      in ruins are a bit flightier now, and will briefly flee combat if attacked -
