  - rscdel: Felinids have been fully removed from code.
  - rscadd: Some Felinid traits have been moved to Tajarans instead. These may or
      may not be removed at a later date.

      Tajarans, Avians and Skrells no longer get paid 0.75x less. Every species gets
      paid 1x (TLDR; payday modifier for species has been removed).
