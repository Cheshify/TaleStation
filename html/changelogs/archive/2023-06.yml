      is given 5 pre-determined locations to pick from instead

      playstyle, however its wing gust now requires a line of sight to targets in
      order to affect them.

      damage values. They also gain a temporary speed boost when hit by Space Dragon's
      fire breath instead of taking damage.
  - balance: Carp rift spawn times have been reduced, the healing AOE is now a 3x3
      instead of a 1x1, and apply normal gravity in a large radius around them

      via action button similar to Raw Prophets and Slimepeople.
