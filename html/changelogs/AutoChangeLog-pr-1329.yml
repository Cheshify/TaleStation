changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed recycler bug that deleted the output stack because it was merged
      with the input stack
  - bugfix: Fixed recycler bug where it deleted stacks of 50 because it didn't have
      enough space by removing recycle bins that reset its internal space from infinity
      to the level of matter bin part
