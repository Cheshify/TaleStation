changes:
  - rscadd: The Mjolnir wizard loadout no longer scams you. It now also grants 1 level
      of Tesla Blast!
  - bugfix: Spells show up in the stat panel again
  - bugfix: Fixes runtime errors that can occur if a wizard spellbook randomizes into
      unpurchasable spells.
  - bugfix: Genetics powers now have their own background, which apparently they have
      always meant to have.
  - bugfix: Fixes some cases where chaplains are unable to cast their own spells.
  - bugfix: Fixes some granters being infinite when they should've been limited (Maint
      loot books).
  - bugfix: Wizard's roundend report is now more accurate in what spells they purchased.
  - balance: The mindswap book now gives a slight message warning it's changed on
      read.
  - balance: Sacred Flame now lets people around them know they're actually being
      made super flammable.
  - balance: Olfaction can't be cast if you have no nose (you're headless).
  - balance: Being Emotemute now prevents you from invoking spells which require emotes
      (mime spells).
  - balance: All wizard spells except Mindswap can't be cast if the wizard is just
      a brain. Most spells didn't work, anyways.
  - balance: PAIs and carded AIs can no longer cast spells. Most spells didn't work,
      anyways.
  - balance: You can't mindswap into PAIs and brains(?).
  - admin: Admins can now add spells by name or typepath.
  - admin: Spell requirements are bitflags now, so you can modify them with the bit-field
      VV ui. Pretty neat.
  - code_imp: proc_holders have been removed from existence.
  - refactor: Wizard, Heretic, Revenant, and Genetics spells are now all action datums.
  - refactor: Xenomorph, Spider, and Cytology monster abilities are now all action
      datums.
  - refactor: Some malf AI and cult abilities are now fully action datums instead
      of an unholy mix of proc holder and action.
  - refactor: Refactored how cult's blood target is set.
  - refactor: Bloodcrawling and jaunting have been completely refactored. Blood crawling
      has been exorcised from the living level of mobs, and the consumption part of
      (s)laughter demons is now handled by the action itself.
  - refactor: The wizard's teleport scroll now actually holds and casts a version
      of the "teleport" spell, instead of fake casting it.
  - refactor: Refactored the wizard spellbook a bit.
  - refactor: Refactored how all item actions are applied and handled.
  - rscdel: SDQL spells have been removed.
