changes:
  - rscadd: You can now remove/add all those ugly species features with the power
      of surgery! A lizards frills, horns, snout and spines, a moths wings and antennae,
      podperson hair and just wings in general
  - rscadd: Species features can be altered by organ manipulation or the new 'feature
      manipulation' surgery! 'Feature manipulation' is a shorter version of organ
      manip that let's you only operate on external features
  - balance: Organ manipulation only works on internal organs now. Use 'feature manipulation'
      for external organs.
  - code_imp: cleans up magic numbers in surgery
