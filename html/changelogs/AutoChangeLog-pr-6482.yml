changes:
  - bugfix: Makes the chaplain's revolver consistent with its immediate sibling, the
      Divine Bow, by giving it similar statistics.
  - code_imp: Makes the chaplain revolver a .38 but prevents it from being loaded
      without using the special prayer action. Also applies a damage multiplier to
      keep it at the original 18 force. Mechanically, no different.
  - code_imp: Removes an unnecessary admin log when removing runes.
