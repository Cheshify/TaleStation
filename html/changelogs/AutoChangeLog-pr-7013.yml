changes:
  - rscadd: 'Expanded the fish breeding and traits system: fish can now pass down
      traits, size and weight to offspring. Some fishes have also a chance to generate
      new kind of fishes if conditions are met.'
  - rscadd: Added a fish analyzer that can be either bought from cargo, or printed
      if the advanced fishing tech node has been discovered.
  - rscadd: The number of fillets a fish can make, its item size or the reagents you
      can get from blending it (yes, you can blend it now) now scale with fish size
      and weight. Fish cases also change size with the fish inside it because of it.
  - rscadd: Added new fishing spots, with new fish and their own traits. This includes
      toilets.
  - balance: Fish feed cans no longer can feed fishes indefinitely, but contain more
      feed now to compensate.
  - balance: It should be easier to fish people out of chasms even without a ruscue
      hook now, as long as you're in proximity of the chasm they fell in.
  - bugfix: You can now examine things, or interact with objects while fishing if
      the fishing rod isn't in your active hand.
