changes:
  - bugfix: The chemical press will now only dispense stored pills/patches/bottles
      while wrenched to the floor. This means you won't leave a trail of pills behind
      you anymore when dragging your chemical press to another location.
  - bugfix: Plumbing machinery can now be rotated via ALT-click when there is no power.
  - bugfix: Plumbing machinery is now programmable without power. It won't produce
      anything without power of course, but at least you can set it up while waiting
      for power to come back.
