changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed the game re-initializing your verbs for no reason when you deadmin,
      which was the cause of the "Your previous action was ignored because you've
      done too many in a second" spam when pressing the Deadmin button.
  - bugfix: The MC tab no longer appears in a "ghost" state in your status tabs after
      you deadmin. Now it's just gone, at long last!
  - code_imp: Prettier should no longer be ran on files outside of the "tgui" folder.
