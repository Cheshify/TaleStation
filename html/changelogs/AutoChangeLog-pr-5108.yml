changes:
  - balance: Makes the syndicate sniper rifle a bolt-action rifle.
  - balance: Sniper rifles have a scope range of roughly 50 tiles.
  - balance: Sniper rifle ammo, if it dismembers your limbs, does damage to the chest.
  - balance: All the various syndicate sniper rifle magazines have consistent casing
      quantities (6 shots). They also have more consistent pricing. 3 for normal and
      a box of surplus, and 4 for every other type.
  - balance: Reduces the range of Marksman ammo to 50 tiles. Not because it is strong,
      but because you might accidentally shoot yourself if you're not watching where
      you're shooting. Ricochets are no joke.
  - rscadd: Replaces Soporific with Disruptor ammo. Works like soporific, but also
      EMPS things it hits.
  - rscadd: Adds Incendiary .50 BMG. Causes a combustion to erupt from the struck
      target, as well as setting targets on fire. Great for parties.
  - rscadd: Adds Surplus .50 BMG. It sucks, but you get a lot of them! Quantity over
      quality, baby.
