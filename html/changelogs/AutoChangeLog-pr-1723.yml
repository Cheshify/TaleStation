changes:
  - bugfix: Fixes most, if not all harddels related to lua.
  - bugfix: Fixed lua signal handlers for COMSIG_PARENT_QDELETED.
  - bugfix: Possibly fixed chat by way of removing seemingly unrelated code that turns
      out to have been unnecessary in the first place.
  - bugfix: In lua, if you shadow the global table (_G), you will no longer be prevented
      from running any further code, and as such, can unshadow the global table.
