changes:
  - refactor: Refactored the manifest code to not rely on generating two photo of
      each character at roundstart. This means that the start of the game should be
      significantly faster.
  - bugfix: The images shown in the manifest no longer look crummy, and will instead
      look exactly like you'd expect them to!
