I was just gonna call it little_Station_Project, but then Whiskey popped into my head. Not because I'm currently drinking some. Not only does it keep in line with the general Nato-esque styling of Station names (Kilo, Delta, Gamma, Tango, Lima) but it also goes in line with (Tram, Box, Pubby). I want to call it Whiskey after both NATO and the fact that we're trying to create a general common artium where you could enjoy a glass of the stuff in a compact, busy, yet peaceful waiting area. If ya don't like it start pitching becasue this is the best I got so far.
